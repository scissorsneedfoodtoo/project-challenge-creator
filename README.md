Instructions:

Clone this repo
Run `npm install`
Copy a project folder into this repo
Change the variables in `index.js` to point to that folder and change the names in there if you need to
Run `node index.js` 
It will create challenge files, a meta file, and an introduction file
Copy and paste those files into the freeCodeCamp repo in their correct areas

If you want to re-run the script, delete the `new-files` folder that was created first.
